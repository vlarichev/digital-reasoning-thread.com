# Digital Reasoning Thread (DRT)

## Overview

Digital Reasoning Thread (DRT) is a comprehensive exploration into the architecture and reasoning patterns of modern software systems. This repository hosts the landing page for the broader DRT research initiative.

## Research Portal

The main research work and detailed explorations can be found at:

## About DRT

DRT is founded on the premise that modern software systems require a deep understanding of both technical implementation and reasoning patterns. The project aims to:

- Explore architectural decisions in modern systems
- Document reasoning patterns and their practical applications
- Bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world implementations
- Create a knowledge base for software architects and developers

## Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the DRT landing page, built with:

- Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Vanta.js for interactive background

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the landing page.

## Contributing

While this repository focuses on the landing page, we welcome contributions to the main research work at our [research portal](https://vlarichev.github.io/digital-reasoning-thread/).
